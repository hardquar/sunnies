<Playground>

    height="200px"

### Lazy loaded image

For situations where an image is displayed below the fold, use the `lazyLoad`
prop. This is an important performance optimization.

<Playground>
  <Image
    lazyLoad
    width="300px"
    height="200px"
    src="https://picsum.photos/300/200/?random"
  />
</Playground>

### Preventing right-click

We generally don't want artwork images to be downloaded by users. Mark an image
with the `preventRightClick` prop, and users will be unable to right click to
"Save Image".

<Playground>
  <Image
    width="300px"
    height="200px"
    src="https://picsum.photos/300/200/?random"
    preventRightClick
  />
</Playground>

### Responsive image

Used to fill an area provided regardless of proportions.

<Playground>
  <BorderBox maxWidth="400px" width="100%" height="auto" p={0}>
    <ResponsiveImage src="https://picsum.photos/400/250/?random" />
  </BorderBox>
</Playground>
